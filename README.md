# FashionMNIST Image Classifier
## Introduction
This program is an image classifier used to classify a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of clothing based on the Fashion MNIST dataset that can be found on Kaggle. The program was written using Python and the Pytorch library to take advantge of its deep learning capabilities, and more specifically, its ability to create convoluted neural networks from which accurate predictions can be learned and made from inputing images and running them through multiple convolution layers in higher dimensions.
